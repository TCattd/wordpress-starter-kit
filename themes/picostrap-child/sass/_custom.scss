NOTICE for beginners: 

    CODE HERE YOUR MASTERPIECE, but before that, if you haven't yet,
    please take your time to understand and study how Bootstrap works.
    It can save you a lot of time,
    eg. to standardize project colors, or fully customize typography.
    First of all, have a ride in the WordPress Customizer.
    Then learn to use Bootstrap 4 Classes and utilities.
    If you come from the CSS world, take some time to study the basic of SASS. It's very powerful.
    With great powers...you are warned
